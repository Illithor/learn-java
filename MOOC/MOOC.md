## Week 1 
1. Classes and interfaces can be grouped into packages.    
 (e.g. Java.lang package contains fundamental classes. Java.util contains a collections of reusable ADTs.)
2. Make classes and interfaces into packages makes it easier to avoid collisions between classes and interfaces that have the same common name.    
 (Remember full name = package name + class name.)
3. Generics?

## Module 1 - Intro
1. Key object-oriented programming concepts: abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
2. Examples of data abstraction features supported by Java: classes, interfaces.
3. `ADT` defines a set of data values and a set of operations on these values.
4. Differences between Java `classes` and `interfaces`: 
 * Java interface cannot be instantiated directly, whereas a class can
 * Java interface provides a subset of the features provided by a Java class
5. Benefits of Java `generics`:
 * ensure compile-type safety when operating on different types
 * help eliminate unnecessary duplication of code
6. Benefit of `inheritance`: enhances reuse by allowing classes to reuse common state and behavior from other class.
7. The purpose of `exception handling`: 
 * separates the control flow paths of normal app execution from the control flow paths of anomalous app execution
 * makes Java apps more robust and easier to understand and evolve
8. The purpose of `polymorphism`: enables transparent customization of methods in a subclass that are inherited from a super class.

## Module 2 - Android Studio
1. File tree:
 * manifests: contains .xml files that describe how the Android platform should interact with your project.
 * java: contains logic and code for the project (source codes files and test files)
 * res: resources (images, layout files etc.)
2. Among them, the two files that you will always create and edit are Java source code and resource files.
 * Java class: CapitalLetterForEachWord
 * layout files: all_lower_case_and_with_underscore.xml
3. Virtual Machine (VM) allows you to run your app on your developing machine as if it is running on an Android machine.
 * API = Application Program Interface
 * ABI = Application Binary Interface
 * For this course, we choose API = `22`, ABI = `armeabi-v7a`, Target = `Android 5.1 (with Google APIs)`.
4. Logging:
 Android has six logging levels: `Assert`, `Error`, `Warning`, `Info`, `Debug` and `Verbose`.    
 While filter the levels, you can only see the level that matches or the levels above the current level.

## Module 3
- `CPU` (central processing unit), the main component of a computer system.
 - `ALU` (arithmatic logic unit), which does all the mathematical and logic computations. 
 - control unit, directs what happens.
- Memory
 - `RAM` (random access memory)
 - `ROM` (read only memory)
 - high speed cache
- Input devices, that allow users to put information into the computer.
- Output devices, that allow the computer to provide information back to the user.

1. `RAM` stores the running program.
2. A `bit` is a binary digit that stores either 0 or 1.    
 A `byte` = 8 `bit`s, every `byte` has a unique address.
3. Java is a bit different from ither languages: its compiler does not produce object code that only runs on a particular computer. Instead, the Java compiler produces what is known as a byte-code, which is object code for a hypothetical computer, or what we call a virtual machine. This byte-code is a low level code that can run on **any computer** that has a piece of software known as the Java Virtual Machine (`JVM`). 
4. A value of any type can be assigned to the type to the right:    
 `byte -> short -> int -> long -> float -> double`
5. If `distance` is `9.7`, then `(int)distance` is `9`, but the value of `distance` does not change - a new value was created to represent the rounded value of distance.
6. %8d = an integer, 8 characters wide, right-aligned    
 %-8d = an integer, 8 characters wide, left-aligned    
 %.4f = a real number, 4 characters after decimal    
 %6.2f = a real number, 6 characters wide, 2 after decimal (rounded)    
 Note that width specifications set a minimum width (it can overflow)
7. Adding a char and an int, returns an int: `'a' + 7 // 104`.    
 To convert back to a char, use a cast: `(char)('a' + 7) // 'h'`
8. Differences between string and char: string is an object so we can call method to it, but char is not an object and we cannot call method to it.
9. Declaring a static method:    
 public static return_type name(parameters) {    
 statement1;    
 statement2;    
 }
10. In the Android, if you have a method that needs to access the out object for printing to the screen, you will need to remove the `static` keyword from the method header for the method to work correctly. If your helper methods simply take in parameters and return values and do not print anything to the out object, then they can remain as static methods.

## Week 2
## Module 4 - Control flows
Intro to if/for/while loop.
Just check the syntaxs online...
![](https://github.com/Illithor/learn-java/blob/master/screenshot/M4L2.png)

## Module 5 - Arrays
1. Arrays can store a large amount of variables as long as they are of the same type.
2. **ZERO base**.
3. Syntax: `type[] array_name = new type[length];`    
 For example, `int[] score = new int[5];`
4. Default values:    
 ![](https://github.com/Illithor/learn-java/blob/master/screenshot/M5L2P1.png)
5. It's easy to process the array with a for-loop.
6. Some examples:
```java
//Returns a new array that has been mirrored.
//Example: [3, 8, 10, 4]=>[3, 8, 10, 4, 4, 10, 8, 3]
public static int[] mirror(int[] orig) {
 int[] tmp = new int[2*orig.length];
 for (int i=0; i<orig.length; i++) {
 tmp[i] = orig[i];
 tmp[tmp.length-i-1] = orig[i];
 }
 return tmp;
}
```

```java
public static double median(int[] numbers) {
 int[] tmp = Arrays.copyOf(numbers, numbers.length); // That is, copy the array named "numbers" and all the values of it.
 Arrays.sort(tmp);
 int mid = tmp.length/2; // Note: int division
 if (tmp.length%2 == 0) { // even length?
 return (tmp[mid-1]+tmp[mid])/2.0; // Note that we use 2.0!!! Float division!!!
 } else {
 return tmp[mid];
 }
}
```
7. For-each loop:    
![](https://github.com/Illithor/learn-java/blob/master/screenshot/M5L3.png)    
 Limitations of for-each loop:
 * only good when you want to read the data in the array. Can not be used if you want to change the data in the array. That is because if you assign a new value to for-each variable, you are only changing the for-each variable, and you are not changing the corresponding element in the array.
 * you do not know which element of the array you are processing on any giving iteration. Cannot return the index of an array element that you are currently processing.
 * always process the array in a forward direction and always in single steps. Cannot process an array in reverse order, or in steps other than one.
 * only iterates over a single array, and thus it is not the best choice when you have a loop that needs to process two or more arrays at the same time.
8. Collection: an object that stores data. 
 Benefits:
 * provide many standard data structures
 * size can grow or shrink (not static)
 * the framework has it's foundation on a set of interfaces that share common methods
 
 Syntax: `Collection<Type> name = new Collection<Type>();`    
 "Collection" can be replaced by ArrayLists, LinkedLists, HashMaps, and TreeSets in Java.
 
 In detail:
 * The set interface, which extends the collection interface provides for unordered collection of elements, which is not allowed duplicates.
 * The list interface provides for an ordered sequence of elements. Because it is ordered, the user can access elements by their integer index. 
 * The map interface provides an object and maps keys to values. This interface is not associated with a collection interface, as it deals with pairs of elements rather than a single element type. A map cannot contain duplicate keys thus each key can map to at most one value.
9. Iteration:

 ![](https://github.com/Illithor/learn-java/blob/master/screenshot/M5L4P2.png)    
10. Three ways to write the same piece of code:
```java
// for loop
// cons: each "get" operation must walk the link list all the way from the first element
List<String> myFriends = new ArrayList<String>();
myFriends.add("Pete");
myFriends.add("Lisa");
myFriends.add("Gus");
for (int i=0; i<myFriends.size(); i++) {
 out.println(myFriends.get(i));
}
```
```java
// for-each loop
// pros: clean and concise, and it is recommended to be used when possible
// cons: for-each loops are read only, and they do not allow you to modify the collection while you are iterating over it
List<String> myFriends = new ArrayList<String>();
myFriends.add("Pete");
myFriends.add("Lisa");
myFriends.add("Gus");
for (String aFriend : myFriends) {
 out.println(aFriend);
}
```
```java
// iterators
// cons: a bit more verbose than using a simple for each loop
// pros: they take care of all the low level details for us and allow us to traverse over a collection regardless of what type of collection it is. They work the same for arrays, linked list, binary trees and hash tables.
List<String> myFriends = new ArrayList<String>();
myFriends.add("Pete");
myFriends.add("Lisa");
myFriends.add("Gus");
Iterator<String> itr = myFriends.iterator();
while (itr.hasNext()) {
 String aFriend = itr.next();
 out.println(aFriend);
}
```
11. ArrayList vs. Array:    
 ![](https://github.com/Illithor/learn-java/blob/master/screenshot/M5L5P1.png)    
 ArrayList's length is dynamic, while Array's length is fixed.    
 ArrayList is ZERO based, same as Array and String. The `size()` of an ArrayList is its logical size (the num. of elements held inside the ArrayList), not the physical size (the num. declared).
 * Pros of ArrayList: increase and reduce the length automatically. Easy to search (which is impossible in Arrays)
 * Cons of ArrayList: You can't use [] to get access to the elements as you did in Arrays. You need to use method calls instead. And ArrayList is a bit less efficient than Array.
12. A very good example about ArrayList: Hangman Game!
```java
// loadWords add the word into the ArrayList if the word has the length required
public static List<String> loadWords(int len,
 String[] ospd)
{
  List<String> words = new ArrayList<String>(1000);
  for (String word : ospd) {
    if (word.length()==len) {
      words.add(word);
    }
  }
  return words;
}

// mustHaveAt removes all the words in the ArrayList without the certain char on the given position
public static void mustHaveAt(char ch, int position,
  List<String> aList)
{
  for (int i=aList.size()-1; i>=0; i--) { // NOTE THAT i counts down backwards! That's because if a element is removed, the rest of the ArrayList will move frontwards to fill the vacant space. So if we count up, we may miss the element that fills the vacant space we just removed an element from.
    String word = aList.get(i);
    if (position >= word.length() ||
      word.charAt(position)!=ch)
    {
      aList.remove(i);
    }
  }
}

// mustNotHave remove all the words in the ArrayList with the certain char on the given position
// Note that we use iteration here. So there's no need to count from the back like we just did.
public static void mustNotHave(char ch,
 List<String> aList)
{
  Iterator<String> itr = aList.iterator();
  while (itr.hasNext()) {
    String word = itr.next();
    if (word.indexOf(ch)>=0) { // a smart way to process
      itr.remove();
    }
  }
}
```
13. HashMap (= association list in Racket):    
![](https://github.com/Illithor/learn-java/blob/master/screenshot/M5L6.png)    
 * Pros: fast insert, fast lookup, fast removal.
 * Cons: unorder, iteration over HashMap will takes more time
 Methods:
 * put(key, value): specify both key and value
 * get(key): specify a key and the value is returned (or null if there's no such value)
 * remove(key): specify the key
 A view is a *dynamic* access into HashMap. If you change the view, the HashMap changes and vice versa    
 
 Requirements for HashMaps:
 * keys and values must be class type
 * and the class type you use must have the method `equal` and `hashCode` defined.
14. An example:
```java
// Given ArrayList<String> words, an array list
// of words to be counted
Map<String, Integer> counts =
 new HashMap<String, Integer>();
for (String word : words){
  word = word.toLowerCase();
  if(!counts.containsKey(word)) {
    counts.put(word, 1);
  } else {
    counts.put(word, counts.get(word)+1);
  }
}
```
